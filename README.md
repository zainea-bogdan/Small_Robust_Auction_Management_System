# ðŸ“„ README â€” Online Auction Platform Database

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project models a **relational database for an online auction platform**, providing functionality to manage users, products, bids, auctions, payments, and delivery statuses. The design ensures traceability, fairness, and security for both buyers and sellers.

## ðŸ§± Database Structure

- **`date_personale`**: Stores personal details of users.
- **`cont_utilizator`**: Handles user accounts and roles (buyer/seller).
- **`categorie_produse`**: Product category classification.
- **`produse`**: Auctionable products with validation flags.
- **`licitatii`**: Auctions organized by sellers with payment, delivery, and status tracking.
- **`lista_oferte`**: Records each offer placed by users.
- **`participare_licitatii`**: Tracks user participation in auctions.
- **Views**:
  - `vw_vanzatori`, `vw_cumparatori`: Filtered users by role.
  - `vw_status_licitatii`: Auction status listing.
  - `vw_oferta_castigatoare`: Winning offer per product.
  - `vw_monitorizare_plata`: Tracks payment status.
  - `vw_monitorizare_livrare`: Tracks delivery progress.

## ðŸ›  Notes

- **Data Population**: Mock data is provided in an Excel file (`auxiliar.xlsx`) in the repository.
- **Constraints & Validations**: Includes checks for date of birth, foreign key references, and status values.
- **Execution Flow**: SQL scripts include creation and teardown of tables and views, along with logic to update auction outcomes.

## ðŸ”§ Project Scope

This version includes **only the basic structural and functional components** required to support core auction operations. Additional features such as user roles, product images, messaging, notifications, or analytics may be integrated in future updates as needed.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Run the provided SQL script in Oracle SQL Developer or another PL/SQL-compatible environment.
2. Import mock data using the Excel sheet.
3. Use the provided views and update scripts to simulate auction outcomes.
