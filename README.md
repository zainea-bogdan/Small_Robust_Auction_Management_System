# Small_Robust_Auction_Management_System
A small database designed for an exercise that describes a few functionalities for managing the activities of an auction organization . 

The data is pure fictive and doesn't represent real data, being  used only for educational purposes and  to test the queries in the main file.  The main scope of this mini project was to review SQL commands and syntax, and to also try and working with importing data from a pre-cleaned excel dataset.
